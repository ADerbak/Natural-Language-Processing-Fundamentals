Thus\\n>> it would seem to be a very good thing you dumped Archer as a reference).\\n> \\n> I was wrong. I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar, and thus\\n> confused \"kleros\", the second to last word in Acts 1:17 as being the plot of\\n> land discussed.  In actuality it is \"chorion\", which is the last word Acts\\n> 1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss \"chorion\" so I\\n> cannot report as to the nuances of the word.\\n\\nI abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from\\nothers, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do\\nnot feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in\\nthis example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research\\nspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not\\nas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am\\nnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns\\nout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \"Greek Lexicon\" renders\\neach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical\\norder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\\nindeed \"chorion.\" \\n\\nNow I\\'ve checked several Greek-English lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\\n\\n\\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, \"country place,\" \\n\\tland, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings.\\n\\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about \"grave.\" As some of these \\nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \\nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \\nthink it more likely that Mr Archer\\'s investigations into \"contradictions\" to \\nbe once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer \\nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \\nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\\nto support Mr Archer\\'s contentions). \\n\\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson\\'s) is the definition of\\n\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\\n\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically noted\\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\\nBullinger\\'s exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew\\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\\nadmit how stupid Bullinger\\'s exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\\nwhich drives the point home). \\n\\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \\nparticular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer\\nquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and \\nthe fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in\\ndiscussing the \"Potter\\'s Field.\"\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler\\n\\n    Precise knowledge is the only true knowledge, and he who does not teach\\n    exactly, does not teach at all.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHenry Ward Beecher\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAmerican Clergyman\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas recorded by George Seldes\\n',\n",

The seller insisted\\nthat it was 'in good condition' when he sent it and so would just return half ofthe amount that I paid if I send the item back to him and after he is sured it\\nis bad. Is this reasonable?\\n\\nBasically I would like to believe the seller tells the truth. Also, I am positively to say that I've not done anything wrong which might cause the failure of \\nthe thing. My assumption here is everyone is honest - so rule out the possibility that either one of the two parties or both are liars.\\n\\nI would like to hear your opinion - either in here or directly respond to my\\ne-mail address.\\n\\nI know there is such a risk that you could lose money.

The FBI and\\nthe BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their\\nstupidity and lies.    \\n\\nNow before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as \\na bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.\\n\\nThey told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet, \\nwhoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into\\ntown on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and \\nwondered why they didn\\'t pick him up then.  There are two possible answers.\\nFirst, they didn\\'t see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they\\ndidn\\'t care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got\\nit.\\n\\nAfter the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were\\ncoming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that.\\nWell, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.\\n\\nDid they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to\\nthem they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised\\nKoresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                 \\n The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out.\\nHis grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh\\'s Real name)  she didn\\'t raise\\nDavid Koresh.\"\\n\\nSomeone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a\\nlogical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.\\n\\nHere\\'s another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that\\nthey feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must\\nbe done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?\\n\\nI knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how\\nmuch money this was costing.  That was the start of the \"Justification\" part\\npart of the plan.  That\\'s when I knew it would come soon.\\n\\nBut, back to the plan.  It is considered \"Cruel and Unusal Punishment\" to\\nexecute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what\\'s acceptable.\\n\\nThey knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not\\nsure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the \\ncompound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were\\nsupposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.\\n\\nI spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR\\n(Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training\\nis going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were\\nsubjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical \\nagent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.\\n\\nI have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of\\nthing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.\\n\\nWe waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these\\npeople 51 days.  \\n\\nI stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole\\nthing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks\\nchanged my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:\\n\\n\"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the\\noperation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal\\nshot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.\"\\n\\nIt took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.\\n\\nOne more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic\\nweapons on the premises. \\n                                                      \\n        HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!\\n\\nTHEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE. THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY!\\n\\nStill, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him.\\nFor all of this my President takes full responsibility.

Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human\\nspecies, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?\\n\\n2) Science cannot explain origins.\\n\\nThis is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends\\non what origins we are talking about.\\n\\n3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins\\nis to say that there is no higher truth than science.\\n\\nAgain, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \"higher\\ntruth\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways\\nto ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even\\nbelieve that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many\\nbelieve that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language\\nof science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \"higher\" or \\n\"lower\"; they are simply true.\\n\\nMore to the point, restricting one\\'s discussion of origins to science\\ndoes not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the\\nscope of discussion.\\n\\n4) This is a false premise.\\n\\nIf this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false\\nthen (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another\\nfalse [or at least theologically unsound] statement.\\n\\n5) By the way, I enjoy science.\\n\\nOn the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science\\nto enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say\\nthat one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read.\\nHowever one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy,\\nperhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.\\n\\n6) It is truly a wonder observing God\\'s creation.\\n\\nLet us not quibble; count this one as true.\\n\\n7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent\\nreligion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]\\n\\nStill another false statement.  However one can make it come out true\\nwith the following contextual modification:\\n\\n\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent\\nof what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of\\nwhat Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\"\\n\\n-----\\n\\nIt is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch\\non truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do\\nhim the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his\\npersonal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that\\nhe has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.\\n-- \\nRichard Harter: SMDS Inc.

Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.\\nIf you experience the problem frequently, it may be \\ncaused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station\\nnearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio \\ntransmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,\\netc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are\\ncorrect in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.\\n\\nIf you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite\\nchokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably\\nbeing picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can\\nbe installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).\\nGood instructions are included with the chokes.\\nIf that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your\\nneighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof\\nor car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things\\na radio operator can do to reduce interference.\\n\\n-- \\n\\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\\nRandall Rhea                                        Informix Software, Inc. \\nProject Manager, MIS Sales/Marketing Systems    uunet!pyramid!infmx!randall\\n',\n",

In addition, the four gospel accounts\\n>        are very much in harmony.  \\n\\nBill, I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the\\nJosephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I mean\\nan expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the\\nchips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be\\ndefined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are\\nnot trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).\\n\\nWhy an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly\\nout of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere \\nin his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which \\nit lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.\\n\\nUntil you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about\\nthe Josephus insert, your \"proof\" is meaningless and it should not be repeated\\nhere.  What\\'s more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would \"prove\"\\nnothing.  Scholars speak of the \"weight of evidence.\"  Far more independent\\nevidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your\\nbelief is based on faith.  That\\'s OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass\\nfaith off as fact.\\n\\nAs for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring\\ninconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn\\'t a perfect canon be perfect? \\nShouldn\\'t there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel \\nFictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for \\nHerb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share \\nan evolutionary ancestry).\\n\\nThe fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny\\nyour position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels \"prove\" your faith. \\nIndependent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already\\ndiscussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. \\nMoreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted\\nto \"prove\" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than\\nsaying \"I am right because I say so.\"  \\n\\nYour logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian \\nGeneral Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where\\n\"fundamentalist\" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)\\nJesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily\\nresurrected, 4) Jesus\\' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the\\nclincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe\\n\"inerrant\" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the\\nfirst four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant\\nbible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to \\ncontain the first four.  \\n\\nSmoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!\\n\\nIts faith, Bill.  You don\\'t have any more or better truths than anyone else. \\nWhatever works for you.  Just don\\'t foist it on others. \\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nRich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota\\n',\n",

I played\\nElvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally made\\na very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel is\\nroughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real time\\nfighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games,\\nespecially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to\\nstay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This \\nis not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is\\nquite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found\\nthat is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting\\nstrategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is \\nno fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain\\nmoderately challanging puzzles.\\n\\nThe really interesting thing about this game is that it is really \\nbroken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibits\\nyou must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transported\\nwith no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits traps\\nyou inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must \\nescape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibit\\ntraps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines\\nand pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant\\nzombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue\\nsome humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill\\nthe very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This is\\nperhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you into\\nJack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper\\nvictim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You must\\navoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and \\nmeet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibit\\npus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to \\nstop the almost indestructible zombies.  \\n\\nOver all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a \\ncreepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, though\\ngameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game.\\nI heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.   \\n\\n*********************************************************\\n\\n- All prices include shipping.\\n- All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated.\\n- US buyers only please.\\n- All games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured,\\n  priority USPS.\\n- All games include all original materials including box, manual,\\n  disks, and registration unless otherwise noted.\\n\\nThe first responder offering asking price is guarenteed to\\nget the game.

They\\nmake reference to several scandals that occurred long before \"the night of the\\nlong knives\". The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of\\nthe SA was common knowledge. Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name\\nescapes me at the moment) called \"Homosexuals in History\" asserts that Roehm\\nand Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm\\'s SA circle.\\n\\n>All the books say that Roehm and his associate, Edmund Heines,\\n>were homosexual.  I have been able to find nothing beyond that, and\\n>suspect this to be a sort of historical urban legend. \\n\\nWell, you\\'re the one who is in Germany. If you don\\'t believe the history books,\\nlook up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not\\nhave access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of\\ndocumented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the \"knight of the\\nlong knives\" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping\\ntogether, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA\\'s\\nhomosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I\\'ve \\nread make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me. \\n\\n>(Irving, a\\n>notoriously unreliable historian, says that Funk, the Nazi finance\\n>minister, was homosexual.  He gives no sources.)\\n\\nI know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do\\nyou know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have\\nread concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that \\nall historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about \\nhomosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don\\'t you think they \\nwould have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?\\nI would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one \\nshould use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. \\n\\n>I challenge anyone to document this claim.\\n\\nIf you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),\\nthen the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where\\nthe stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to\\narchival material - most people on the net are not.\\n\\n>I *have* found a great\\n>deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the\\n>Nazis.  This seems to include all of the worst ones--Hitler, Himmler,\\n>Goebbels, Goering, Heydrich, Eichmann, and many more.\\n\\nEh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so\\nthat you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis\\nmight have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is\\ntrue? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?\\n\\nI don\\'t know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were\\nhomosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious\\nfor its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German\\ngovt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser\\'s friends\\nwere prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long\\ntradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -\\nback to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a \\nproduct of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the\\nEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,\\nwould have been quite willing to overlook Roehm\\'s homosexuality.\\n\\nIn addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The\\nHitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various \\npre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote \\nhomoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So \\nit seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, \\nregardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the \"evils\" of homosexuality.\\nWhy should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all \\nsocieties - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.\\n\\nNo, I don\\'t have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you\\nwill accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access \\nto these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern\\nhomosexuality that I have ever read - I don\\'t have the time. Nothing is\\nstopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you prove\\notherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.\\n                                                                           \\n/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\nDavid Matthew Deane (deane@binah.cc.brandeis.edu)\\n\"...Be in me as the eternal moods of the bleak wind...Let the Gods speak softly\\nof us in days hereafter...\" (Ezra Pound)\\n/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\n',\n",

Advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planet\\nwho have no desire to receive advertising is not okay.\\n\\n\\t   Those of us who pay for Internet access are constrained only\\n\\t   by our innate good taste and no have no \"administrator\" to \\n\\t   guide(?) us.\\n\\nI suspect that a site which generated a large volume of material not\\nin anybody\\'s good taste would find itself getting a lot of attention\\nit didn\\'t want.  You may belong to the public library, but that\\ndoesn\\'t mean you can deface the books, disorder the stacks, or disturb\\nthe other patrons.\\n\\nYou\\'re constrained by the same rules that the rest of the users (many\\nacademic and military, who get irritable about a network for which\\nthey pay with tax and grant money carrying private business\\nadvertising) follow.  There are Secret Masters here, just like\\neverywhere else.  They\\'re not as obvious as the ones on Prodigy, but\\nthey\\'re here.\\n\\nNo doubt at some point the Internet, like everything else, will become\\ngrotty enough to carry advertising.  At that time I hope it is\\nconfined to its own newsgroups and not on discussion groups---like\\nmisc.writing.\\n\\n\\nElizabeth Willey\\n',\n",

Of course, you could trim the 110Hz\\noscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator\\nremaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.\\n\\nI would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the\\nsolenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.\\n\\nCaveat - I\\'m not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can\\'t\\nguarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable\\nconditions.\\n\\nJohnH\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\\\/           School of MPCE\\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\\n\\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

Automatic setups are fine for simple,\\nrepetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more\\ncomplex events where you need to understand how the scope is\\nactually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope\\nin \"equivalent time\" or in \"real time\" sampling mode (equivalent time\\nbeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to\\nthe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope\\'s actual sampling\\nrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but\\nbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.\\n\\nIs the HP scope you\\'re using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz\\nsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front\\nend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for\\nequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really\\nonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single\\nsample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.\\n\\nSo, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get\\nuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for\\ngeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage for\\nlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability\\nof the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to\\nfall...\\n\\n-- \\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n       Dave Medin\\t\\t\\tPhone:\\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\\n    SSD--Networking\\t\\t\\t\\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\\n    Intergraph Corp.\\n       M/S GD3004 \\t\\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\\t\\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\\n\\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\\n\\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)\\n',\n",

Gay people are and will\\ncon- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may\\nbe unaware of all the statistica \"findings\" concerning African-Americans that\\nhave been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias\\nagainst African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances,\\nbut there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public\\nscoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.\\nFortunately African-Americans had \"whites\" who supported their \\'cause\\' and\\npublic sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was\\neven a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws\\nwere put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty\\nmuch legal to discriminate against them.\\n\\nI know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free\\nform discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something,\\nthat is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)\\nopenly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,\\nincluding gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation\\nand making disciples.  We believe in the Lord\\'s great commandment to Love,\\nand we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular\\nto do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a\\nchurch almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes\\nin the commandment of Love (though I\\'m hard-pressed to find many who actually\\nsho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially\\nwithin their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian\\ncommunity for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists\\nagainst the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and\\ntreated as runaway slaves for being \"nigger-lovers\" and such.  I guess I\\'ve\\ndecided the challenge is worth it.\\n\\nIn my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic\\nstory centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight\\nwho have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don\\'t know of one\\ncase where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject\\ntheir gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they\\nbegan to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.\\n\\nI\\'m apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0\\nraged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values\\nCoalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner\\nsupport within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more\\noppressive legisation against gays.\\n\\nPerhaps you don\\'t get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn\\'t get it in the\\nMiddle Ages and the proclaimed God\\'s will be done as they massacred thousands\\nin witch hunts and inquisitions.\\n\\nThe message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay\\nrights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even\\nhatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn\\'t change\\nthe results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the\\nfinal effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a\\n\"conditional\" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we\\'ll love you. This is\\nsure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an \"unconditional\"\\nlove, one that calls people \"just as they are.\"  Sure there are things that\\nwill \\'naturally\\' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that\\nneed to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things\\nlike left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is\\ngoing to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to \"other\\npeople\\'s expectations.\" In the process this coerced conformity causes many\\npeople a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have\\nnothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their\\nown sense of pseuper-spirituality.\\n\\nThis is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be\\nunpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with\\nsomething very personal like \\'sexuality\\' (a taboo subject even today), but I\\nfirmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation\\non thier bedrooms.  It\\'s funny that most straight people have successfully\\nremoved restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,\\nbut we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it\\nhelps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.\\nGay people are not criminals.\\n\\nAnother interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic\\nchurch in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it\\'s pastors arrested for self-\\nadmitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently\\nbeen going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were\\nvoluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that\\nwas how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing\\nhappen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends\\nrecently told me he was \"approached\" by someone who is going through the\\nreparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for\\ndinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.\\n\\nThese are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and\\ncreating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not\\nthe call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in\\nColorado has created an organization who\\'s posters are appearing all over\\nColorado called \"S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T.\" (I forget the whole definition off hand,\\nbut the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto\\nis \"Working for a fag-free America\" with an implicit advocation for violence.\\n\\nThis is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are\\nembracing.\\n\\nWe Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression\\ntowards those we feel don\\'t \\'measure up\\', and constant beratement from\\norganizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good\\npurpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of\\nexcluding people.\\n\\nThe Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to \"include\"\\npeople.  I have several of Dr. Martin\\'s books and find them quite helpful,\\nespecially concerning \\'cults.\\' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto\\nitself.  Why don\\'t we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people\\nto Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?\\n\\nWhatever\\n\\nRich :-(\\n',\n",

Christian people have caused\\n\"objective morality\" to look very \"relative.\"  After all, that was the\\npoint of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out\\nChristianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own\\nprinciples?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this\\napparent inconsistency from at least one Christian\\'s viewpoint:\\n\\nIf God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then\\nHe has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick\\nphysically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an \"objective\" morality for us.\\nThat is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or\\ndetrimental to) the creature He created. \\n\\n\\tGalatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in\\n\\tChrist Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared\\n\\tbeforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.\\n\\nHowever, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees\\nof the Bible,) God\\'s morality cannot be completely codified in a list\\nof rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a\\nperson\\'s life creates a new situation to which morality must be\\napplied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God\\'s\\n\"objective\" morality for us. \\n\\nThroughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of\\nrules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have\\nboth principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the\\nprinciples were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules.\\nVolumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the\\napplication of the principles.  We [mankind] weren\\'t comfortable with\\nthe \"subjectivity\" of principles. \\n\\n\\tFor reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference\\n\\tbetween the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in\\n\\tverses 21-22:  \"You have heard that the ancients were told,\\n\\t\\'You shall not commit murder\\'...and \\'Whoever commits murder shall\\n\\tbe liable to the court.\\'  But I say to you that everyone who is\\n\\tangry with his brother shall be liable to the court...\"\\n\\nThe \"objective morality\" of God gets blurred by our inept\\ninterpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors\\nwhen we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY\\nwhat God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to\\nseeking God\\'s will instead of trying to prove we already had it all\\nfigured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God\\'s\\n\"objective morality\" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he\\nwas/is (and that\\'s the fundamental question,) then HE IS \"objective\\nmorality.\" \\n\\nJohn Nunnally\\n',\n",

Is this true?\\n\\nI own the Adcom 60W power amp.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no\\n  amp which can touch it at the price range.\\nThe build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other \\n  amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid\\n  with massive heat sinks and very solid casing.\\nIf you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components \\n  in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect\\n  symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each\\n  channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are\\n  virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.\\n\\nI was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east\\n  or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components\\n  they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the\\n  amplifiers sound so brilliant.\\nI cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with\\n  those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly\\n  hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.\\n\\nMy last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like\\n  the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded\\n  like new.\\n\\nIf you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom's, they will\\n  sound brilliant and last a long time - period.\\n\\nJust my thoughts, but then - I do own one of Adcom's amps.\\n\\n--\\n***********************************************************************\\n**    Alan Webber                                                    **\\n**                      webb@itu1.sun.ac.za                          **\\n**                      webb@itu2.sun.ac.za                          **\\n**                                                                   **\\n** The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high  **\\n** The ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by          **\\n** Apprehension creeping like a choo-train up your spine             **\\n** Will the tightrope reach the end; will the final couplet rhyme    **\\n***********************************************************************\\n\",\n",

It was the religion of the great Persian\\nEmpire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ\\nwas born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three\\nZoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians,\\nJews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the\\nZoroastrian prophet.\\n\\n   Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are \\na miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a\\npeople is very much on their minds.\\n\\n   Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance\\nof the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed\\nby nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause\\ntheir young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.\\n\\n   Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they\\nactually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children\\nbecome totally assimilated, they say, it\\'s their children - rather than\\nthe world at large - who will be the losers.\\n\\n   \"It\\'s important to have an identity,\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose,\\na leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \"It\\'s important\\nfor everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life.\\nYou don\\'t have to depend on the majority community to give you respect.\\nYou can fall back on your own identity.\"\\n\\n   For Zoroastrians, there\\'s much to be proud of.\\n\\n   Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which\\nanimal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was\\nonly one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which\\ntranslates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.\\n\\n_Good vs. evil_\\n\\n   Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with\\nthe good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for\\ngood, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences\\nsuch as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity,\\nkindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of\\nmen and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.\\n\\n   But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to\\nfollow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact,\\nJoseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths,\\ntraced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.\\n\\n   Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a\\nstained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of\\nMount Hamilton, is \"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\"\\n\\n   So it\\'s not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India,\\nwhere a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape\\npersecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy;\\nthe overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.\\n\\n   About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India\\nand Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from\\nIran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state\\nwhere others had no rights.\\n\\n   Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \"good\\ndeeds\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose,\\nthe recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because\\nManou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up\\ndowntown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple\\'s\\ndedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the\\nZoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.\\n\\n   The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an\\nIranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples\\nin North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount\\nHamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto,\\nand Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on\\nthis continent.\\n\\n   Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the\\nproperty already had a large house that they have converted to a\\ncommunity center.\\n\\n   The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet \\nZoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted \\nceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.\\n\\n   Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed-\\nin area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are \\nsometimes called \"fire worshippers,\" they actually consider fire just \\na symbol of God.  \"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the \\ncross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\" Bhujwala said.\\n\\n   The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all\\nIranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of\\nthe season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With\\nZoroaster\\'s birthday just six days later, the combination of religious\\nand secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the\\nUnited States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.\\n\\n  For this year\\'s celebration of the prophet\\'s birthday, about 500 people\\ncame to worship and revel.\\n\\n   \"The good things in life are not forbidden,\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani,\\na leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed\\nproved him right.\\n\\n   Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood\\naround the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted\\nthanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking\\nsandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit\\nand nuts.\\n\\n   Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \"People eat the\\nfruit,\" Tarapore said.  \"It\\'s a way to participate in the ceremony.\"\\n\\n_Santa Claus, sort of_\\n\\n   The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white\\nhair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green\\nsymbolic of spring) and red.\\n\\n   He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and\\nplayed a tambourine.\\n\\n   The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  \"This is all new for us, too,\"\\none told a visitor who asked what was going on.\\n\\n   A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with\\nthe religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have\\nno procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their\\ncenturies of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu\\nking who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his\\npeople\\'s religion.\\n\\n   But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the\\nSan Jose temple whenever he can.\\n\\n   \"When I first heard about this religion,\" he said, \"I thought, my God,\\nthis is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.\\n\\n   \"People who don\\'t have a tradition, something to lean on, what\\'s the\\ndifference with the lower animals?\"\\n\\n------------------------------------------------ end of article ---- \\n',\n",

If\\nyou are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will\\nnot be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. \\nThe fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle\\n(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of\\nthe law is no excuse - they will get you too!\\n\\nIt used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for\\nan officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many\\nlaw enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. \\nRight, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF\\nfrom the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was \"no way!\" \\nBut, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police\\nare writing citations right and left for people using radar\\ndetectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had\\nfound the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,\\nand he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was\\nthere.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.\\n\\nNow, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or\\nnear the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me\\nfrom getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my\\nspeed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar\\ndetector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which\\nis what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to\\nobey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.\\n\\nFor my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only\\nworks in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave\\nenlightment may be necessary.\\n\\nSo, the questions are -\\n  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?\\n  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by\\n  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector\\n  antenna?\\n  Are any brands \"quieter\" than others?\\n\\n==============================================================================\\nRandy T.

Several\\npeople responded with good information, but I don't think I communicated \\nexactly what I am looking for.\\n\\tI'm working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a host\\nvia RS-232.

In looking around, I see that lots\\nof people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to be\\ninterfaced to your custom I/O devices.  It's been done so much, that it \\nwould be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to use\\nan 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then \\ntransfer control to that program.  Well, there's one other thing the ROM\\nneeds to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytes\\nto/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS).\\nEverything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  That's too much for\\nthis application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UART\\nbuilt-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.

However, it\\'s still a heck of a machine for the price -- it\\nis quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it.  (It\\'s probably the\\nmost popular walkman-style DAT machine out there.)\\n\\n        Anyway, the guy selling it is Bryan Davis (bdavis@netcom.com), and\\nhere\\'s what he told me:\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nHere is what is included:\\n        - TCD-D3 DATman.\\n        - (2) RCA to Stereo 1/8\" plug cables.  One for analog input, one for\\n          analog output.\\n        - Optical digital I/O cable (one lead for input, one for output).\\n        - A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase.  The\\n          unit is still under factory warrantee.\\n        - AC adaptor/battery charger.\\n        - Rechargable battery.\\n\\nI paid $750 + tax for it so I hope you don\\'t mind if I keep the 60 minute\\ntape it came with (I have some samples on it!).\\n\\n[By the way, he spent at least $100 too much for it, unless he\\'s including an\\n extended warranty, which is advised for DAT machines, since it costs about\\n $300 to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within 5\\n years if you use it a lot.. -- davisonj]\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n        I\\'m not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice.\\nSend him mail and ask him what he wants.\\n\\n        Again, I\\'ve used the TCD-D3, and I have to say that I can certainly\\nunderstand why it is as popular as it is.  I\\'ve been using one for a little\\nwhile, and although I had some problems with it recently, I should also point\\nout that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years and\\nhad truly been _used_ during that time.  (This is the same exact DAT machine\\nthat was lugged around the U.S. and Canada to record the Jazz Butcher\\nConspiracy for their recent live album.)\\n\\n        Bryan Davis says:\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nI know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels\\nin S.F who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reported\\nproblem.  My problem is that everyone I know already has one.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n        \\'nuff said.\\n\\n        The reason I\\'m not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a\\nunit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don\\'t have any\\noptical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also has\\nsome other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn\\'t.  (I am also paying more\\nfor the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters are\\navailable if you absolutely must have one.\\n\\n        Of course, it has SCMS.

Hopefully, you won\\'t\\nget flamed, either.\\n\\nYou will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is\\nbuilt on unsteady ground.\\n\\nFirst, I do not believe that there is any way to find an \"objective morality\". \\nMorality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a\\nperson or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even\\noverwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.\\n\\n> Assumptions:\\n> \\n> (1) A Christian bedrock assumption that all that is True, comes\\n> Truly from God. \\n> \\n> (2) Regarding alt.sex.stories.

If, as you say,\\nyou are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by\\nusing the Christian Bible?  You\\'re defeating your own purpose by doing so.\\n \\n> In the long run, the advantage of making such a literary/moral\\n> analysis is that it will save band-width between Christians and\\n> non mutually flaming each other about the moral acceptability of\\n> the stuff on these (pornographic) groups.\\n\\nThird, call me a pessimist, but you won\\'t stop the flamage.  There will always\\nbe people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we\\nall are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the\\nreligion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring,\\noverbearing totalitarianists?\\n \\n> Basically, there should not be a dissonance between a \"Christian\"\\n> morality and a \"non-Christian\" one.  Either there is value in a\\n> particular work, or there is not whether one is a Christian or\\n> not.\\n\\nHm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to\\ndiscuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I\\nstart off by saying that I think it\\'s immoral to force people to have sex with\\nyou.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of\\nyour own gender.  (Just a note: I really don\\'t know your views on\\nhomosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the\\npurposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to\\nhave their faces uncovered.\\n\\nThe sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but\\nfeels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind. \\n                                                                         \\n> In support for the first assumption:\\n> \\n> The Christian scriptures say this:\\n\\n\\t(Evidence deleted)\\n\\nI\\'m not going to accept your evidence for this.  You ask us to accept \"The Word\\nof God\" that everything good comes from God.  This is only a valid argument for\\na person who shares your beliefs.\\n\\nStill, I must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs in erotica could\\nbe interesting for other reasons than yours, so good luck with this next part.\\n\\n>                                                                        \\n>              **************************************\\n> \\n> NOW THEN what are some of the major themes/motifs in the\\n> pornographic literature on places like alt.sex.stories?

What is the source of this pseudo-doctrine? Who is\\n> the pseudo-teacher? Who is the Great Deceiver?\\n\\nOK, here\\'s at least one Christian\\'s answer:\\n\\nJesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes\\nsense.  Matt 5:17 \"Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or\\nthe Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\"  Jesus lived\\nunder the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises\\nof the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey\\nGod\\'s purposes.\\n\\nVerse 18 says \"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass\\naway, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law,\\nuntil all is accomplished.\"  The key to this verse IMHO is the last \\nphrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, \"accomplished\" what the \\nLaw was supposed to accomplish.  \\n\\nVerse 19:  \"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,\\nand so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;\\nbut whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the\\nkingdom of heaven.\"  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish \\npeople about living lives under the law, this makes sense.\\n\\nIn general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he \\nmust have received about \"doing away with the Law.\"  That was not \\nJesus\\' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it \\nshould be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his \\npeople all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your \\nheel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be \"doing \\naway with the Law\" because he did not honor the traditions of men as \\nequal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious \\nleaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only \\nGod\\'s Law.\\n\\nIn the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law \\nand defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon \\non the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people \\nunderstand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which \\nhad been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.\\n\\nIn Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the \\nLaw in this way:\\n\\n[23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being \\nshut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore \\nthe Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be \\njustified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no \\nlonger under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith \\nin Christ Jesus.\\n\\nI believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had \\nserved it\\'s purpose, i.e. \"our tutor to lead us to Christ,\" and\\nnow, \"we are no longer under a tutor.\"  The law has been \"fulfilled\" \\nas Christ said he would do.\\n\\nGod, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same\\npersonality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the \"last\\nwill and testament\" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles. \\nIt makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are\\nre-expressed in Christianity. \\n\\nOn the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it\\'s purpose and \\nChristians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes \\nsense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to \\nrepresent the \"mysteries\" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism \\nrepresenting Christ\\'s death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8),\\nThe Lord\\'s supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and\\nSunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff,\\nActs 20:7)\\n\\nOK, That\\'s one Christian\\'s explanation.  I don\\'t claim to have all\\nthese issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome\\nother Christians to offer other alternatives.\\n\\nPlease excuse the long posting.

An awful lot of the\\nstarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic\\npolicies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical\\nWesterner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible\\nmalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can\\nbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They\\nhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans\\nwe encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre\\nidea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they\\'ve got.\\n\\nPerhaps it\\'s more accurate to say that there\\'s a Western ethic against\\nWestern infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children\\nare dying in the Third World, we couldn\\'t give a shit.  And that goes for the\\nsupposed \"Pro-Life\" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by\\nfighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against\\nabortion.  Hell, if they\\'re only interested in fetuses, they could save more\\nof those by fighting for human rights in China.\\n\\nAnd besides, Suzanne\\'s answer implies that non-Western countries lack this\\nethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory\\nforced abortion in Tibet, I don\\'t believe this to be the case.\\n\\n\\nmathew\\n',\n",

(There\\'s a gripe in the industry\\nthat nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it\\'s\\nmore important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system\\nas cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.  \\n\\n       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they\\nusually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the\\nway down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,\\nrather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \"thermal \\npollution\" de-icing a river, said, \"Up here, we view heat as a resource\".  \\n\\n       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is \\npurified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when\\nthe water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than \\ncooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJohn Nagle\\n',\n",

       " \"From: wellison@kuhub.cc.ukans.edu\\nSubject: Re: Help with ultra-long timing\\nOrganization: University of Kansas Academic Computing Services\\nLines: 33\\n\\nThanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and I am looking at using a\\ncouple of the ideas. I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.\\nspec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C\\nand sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time\\ndelay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this\\napplication, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger\\npins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is\\ndisabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.\\nWhen triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x\\nthe timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can\\nbe programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting\\nany combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it\\nis, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K\\nresistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of\\n2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)\\nOf course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for\\n256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.\\nAfter the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14\\nday timing cycle and so forth.\\n\\nPower is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the\\nelectronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet\\npuker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to\\nkeep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to\\nwork for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts\\nto spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see\\nwhat I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that\\nhas to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns\\noff ;-)\\n\\nThanks again everyone...\\n\\n-=-= Wes =-=-\\n\",\n",

Good and\\nevil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.\\n\\nThe Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of\\nbeing. The warring opposites within us are a product of man\\'s\\nrebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of\\nthe Scriptures.\\n\\nMan was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words\\nof St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was\\nthat God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the\\nEastern Orthodox Church, this is called \"theosis,\" or \"deification.\"\\n\\nOne can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul,\\nand body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture\\nof the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs\\nwas a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the\\nCreator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God,\\ntheir natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly\\nirreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in\\ntheir lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This\\nis symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.\\n\\nThe beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it\\nwere to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil,\\nits paradisiac state would also be destroyed.\\n\\nWas it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of\\ninnocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining\\nof self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His\\nmasterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?\\n\\nGod must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral\\nvalue, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There\\nis no other way to achieve union with God.\\n\\nJesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities.\\nHe was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites,\\nand making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God,\\nnot in His essence, but in His energies.\\n\\nThe opposites is THE Christian problem.

Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain \\nknowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the\\nBible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and\\nthere exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond\\nour shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself  \\nto seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a\\nperson who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find \\nsomething to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one\\nwill gain with that attitude is folly.\\n\\nBe careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages\\nin the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even\\nthough they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not.\\nBe assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such\\ndeep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. \\nI will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, \"You will never\\nbe thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.\"\\n\\n\\nFrom King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):\\n\\n    \"It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;\\n     to search out a matter is the glory of kings.\"\\n\\n\\nJesus says in John 6:44 & 55:\\n\\n   \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.\"\\n\\n\\nAnd in John 3:16:\\n\\n   \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,\\n   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal\\n   life.\"\\n\\n\\nYou are included in \"whosoever\".  And I also pray that the Father is\\ndrawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn\\'t be posting\\nto talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the\\nmaking.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure\\nstoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became\\non of the most celebrated men in the history of God\\'s church.\\n\\nYou see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because\\nyou could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack\\nChristians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul,\\nproclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.\\n\\nOr you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would \\nprobably say to you: \"Satan would surely like to have you.\"  Why so?\\nBecause Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great\\nmoments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task\\nhe did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the\\nfaith to walk on water as Jesus did.\\n\\nYou asked \"Why not believe in Zeus?\"  Zeus didn\\'t offer eternal life.\\nYou got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus.\\n\\n-------------------------------\\nBrian Ceccarelli\\nbrian@gamma1.lpl.arizona.edu\\n',\n",

OK ?\\nLet me try to explain what that tower is used to:\\n   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.\\n         It has an hightech \"boiler\" but the rest is still verry verry \\n         conventional. And if you\\'ve already visited any condensation-\\n         powerstation you\\'l have seen the cooling towers too.\\n         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you\\'ll find\\n         a chapter about the \"CARNOT-process\" which describes how to\\n         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason\\n         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you\\'ve an\\n         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one \\n         side and need to cool down the steam \\'till you get water\\n         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the \\n         energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to\\n         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \"cold\"\\n         steam on the other side you\\'ll loose much more of the energy.\\n         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of\\n         energy that carnot will give them.\\n         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !\\n         The vapor you\\'ll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,\\n         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in\\n         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent\\n         radioactive pollution of the environment !\\n         \\n   -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-\\n         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still\\n         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere\\n         around 2000 deg. celsius !

Apparently land-based\\n>beacons tranmit GPS correction information to your GPS \\n>receiver (with differential option installed).\\n\\n>How does this system work?  What frequency is used for\\n>the land-based beacons?\\n\\n>Thanks in advance,\\n\\n>Charlie Thompson\\n>.\\n\\nHere\\'s a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station\\nwith a very exactly known position computes the errors in the\\nincoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors\\nincluding atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time\\ndithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational \\nequipment to \"back out\" the errors in its position (since it knows\\nwhere it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a \\nbroadcast which is available to any number of relatively local\\nreceivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using\\nthe same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very\\nsimilar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the\\nreceiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference\\nunit.\\n\\nThe US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series\\nof coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will\\nuse existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately\\n305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals\\non different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers\\ncorrection signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system\\nwhich has stations all across the US.\\n\\nThe correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format.\\nAdvertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJohn P.

I\\nhave seen the film called \"The Gay Agenda\" and along with my church we found\\nit to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of\\neditting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia\\nfamiliar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people\\nare actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither\\nyou nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as\\nmany as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life\\nI have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something\\nobviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are\\ninnately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an\\nabolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not\\nsupport wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian\\nFundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants\\nyour report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed\\nhomosexuality from it\\'s list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that\\nthere are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list.\\nI do not feel threatened by gays, I don\\'t understand why others are.\\n\\nThe following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min-\\nistries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.\\n\\nTHE FOUNDER OF AN \"EX-GAY\" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO\\n\\nby Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)\\n\\nIn December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate\\'s homophobia rewaa\\nawards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE\\nINDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering\\ndiscontented gays and lesbians \"a way out of the homosexual death-style\"\\nthrough prayer.  \"I\\'d like to give the award back,\" Caligiuri now laughs, \"I\\'m\\nno longer deserve it.\"\\n  Caligiuri\\'s eight year involvement with the national \"ex-gay\" movement peaked\\nwith his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well\\nas Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex-\\ngay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  \"There\\'s no reality\\nin it,\" he says, \"I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.\"\\n  Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the\\norganizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again\\nChristianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who\\nare just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their\\nsexual urges and embracing Christianity.  \"We offer support to people who are\\nseeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,\" explains Bob Davies, director of\\nExodus.  He ventures that \"about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo-\\nsexuality are men.\"\\n  \"Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting\\ntheir time,\" says Lisa Seeley, a former \"redeemed lesbian\" who worked with\\nCaligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  \"These\\norganizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.\"\\n  \"It\\'s possible to change your identity or your behavior,\" says sex educator\\nBrian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. \"But it\\'s really impossible to\\nchange your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay,\\nbut they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.\"\\n  Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all\\nhell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both\\ntheir romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted\\nby a man he picked up in a bar.  \"I was really drunk,\" he recalls, \"and I\\nwent home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all\\nnight, and the next morning he raped me again.\"\\n  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the\\nhome he shared with his ex-lover.  \"He had another man there with him,\"\\nCaligiuri recalls.  \"I thought at this time, \\'If this is what being gay is\\nabout, I don\\'t want to be this way anymore.\"\\n  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery\\nwith others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix\\'s\\ngay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its\\nfirst public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,\\nFree Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed\\nfor hell.\\n  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks\\nin part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  \"We were listed\\nunder Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,\" Caligiuri says, \"so people\\nthought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out\\nwhere the local bars were, and we\\'d preach to them about the sins of homo-\\nsexuality.\"  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says,\\nadding, \"They\\'ll do anything to reach these people.\"\\n  \"David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,\" recalls Peter\\nKelly, a counselor at Phoenix\\'s Catholic diocese AIDS program, \"like that\\nhe knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.\"\\n  Caligiuri\\'s family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on\\nRaphael\\'s syndicated talk show in 1985.  \"They were relieved,\" he recalls.\\n\"They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better\\nthat I should be a \\'reformed\\' gay person.\"\\n  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  \"By the time I appeared on Sally\\'s\\nshow,\" \"I\\'d started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline\\nand tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their\\nfather.  I was horny all the time.\"\\n  Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his\\nnumerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he \"used to go to bookstores\\nand get blowjobs.\"  When he wasn\\'t working the bookstores, he was sleeping\\nwith other \"reformed\" homosexuals.\\n  \"I didn\\'t realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex\\nwith one another,\" Caligiuri says.  \"We\\'d go to conferences in other cities,\\nand we\\'d be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody\\nelse.\"\\n  By the time he appeared on \\'AM Philadelphia\\' television show in May 1988,\\nCaligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show\\'s\\nhost asked him if he ever \"acted on temptation,\" his answer was a lie.\\n  Caligiuri\\'s duplicity began to take it\\'s toll on him, however.  He was\\nsuffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating\\nyeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  \"I was too sick\\nto go to church,\" he explains.  \"The more time I spent away from those people\\nthe more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.\"\\n  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local\\nchurch and closed the ministry\\'s doors.  \"I\\'d convinced myself that there\\nis no need in the world for ex-gay people,\" he says.\\n  Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (\"I\\'m interest-\\ned in belief systems that aren\\'t judgemental.\"), considering romance (\"But\\nnot with a CHristian!\"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to.\\n\"I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,\" he says.  \"I want to\\neventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I\\nmay have brought to our community.\"\\n\\n---end article---\\n\\nCaligiuri\\'s tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles\\nof former leaders and founders of \\'ex-gay\\' ministries who have said very similar th\\nsimilar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have\\ncome to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some,\\nlike Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian \"Lazarus Project\" of West\\nHollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community\\nto bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values\\nof sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become\\nand become close friends with many who once attended such groups as \"Love In\\nAction\" and others, who either once claimed to have been \"reformed\" or who\\nwere too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed\\nin them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of \"sealing\" their\\nnew heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses\\nand bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of\\nnight and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous \"sin\"\\nthrough a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch\\nhas dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-\\ncent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet\\nthe church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow\\ngay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also\\nmrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and\\nfear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on\\nthem, they may even opt for \\'suicide\\' or surgical dampering of the brain\\nfunctions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-\\nplace.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the\\nthreat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington\\'s\\n_\"Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact\\nbased books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as\\nMaury Johnston\\'s _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser\\'s _Come Hom!_.  I\\nseriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and\\nself-acceptance.\\n\\nThank you.\\n',\n",

A set of rules is a moral code or a\\n> law code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful\\n> to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a\\n> personal involvement in and responsibility for one\\'s actions. ...\\n\\nThe two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that are\\nso vague that they are practically devoid of meaning.  Michael\\nSiemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution\\nof an argument over them turns on secular and cultural\\nassumptions that are independent of these rules.\\n \\n> ... The Great  Commandment is, more than anything else, a call\\n> to act *as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility*\\n> in your every action. ...\\n\\nThe commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed,\\nin part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if\\nhe has \"ultimate responsibility.\" Indeed, many traditions present\\nan interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret\\nloving one\\'s neighbor as following various other rules, and\\nrelying on their god to make things come out right, precisely\\nbecause it would be wrong for man to assume such \"ultimate\\nresponsibility.\" Once again, we are confronted with good sounding\\ngoo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean. \\n\\n> ... \"Conservatives\" may twist this \"act as if you were God\" to \\n> mean \"lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them\\n> as possible if they don\\'t keep YOUR rules.\"  They are so\\n> insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a\\n> lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such \\n> idiocy IS how God acts. ...\\n\\nAnd who is to say that this interpretation is \"twisted\"?  There\\nare many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward\\nreading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.\\nMichael cannot refer to \"base\" claims or base commandments to\\nshow that such readings are \"twisted,\" because this divergence in\\nunderstanding occurs even in trying to interpret the \"base\"\\nclaims and commandments.  In addressing conservative Christians,\\nMichael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions\\nthat these conservative Christians will reject.  \\n\\n> But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our\\n> society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It\\n> may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems\\n> -- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.\\n\\nBut these base commandments are too vague to serve as  \"a\\nprinciple for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems.\" The meaning of\\nthese base commandments for any believer derives from the secular\\nand cultural notions that the believer brings to them, from how\\nthe believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of\\nother Biblical passages, from a particular sectarian tradition,\\nor from some combination of these things.  These commandments\\nlack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for\\ncriticizing ethical systems.  What meaning they have comes from\\nthe ethical system the believer brings to these commandments. \\n\\n> And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged\\n> *different* \"ethical systems\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,\\n> it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular\\n> (or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.\\n> It does not have a QU\\'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very\\n> little, if anything, in the way of \"commandments\" -- so little that\\n> the \"Christians\" who desperately *want* commandments go \"mining\" for\\n> them with almost no support ... The one, single, thing in the gospels\\n> which Jesus specifically \"gives\" as \"a commandment\" to us is \"love\\n> one another.\"\\n\\nJesus explicitly states that this summarizes Jewish law, which\\nwould seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what\\nit means to love God and love our neighbors.  There are *many*\\nparables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that are\\nstraightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  The Pauline\\nepistles are similarly full.  If it is not clear that these all\\ncome together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior,\\nthe problem is *not* a lack of raw material. \\n\\n-*----\\n> I am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\\n\\nNo, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel \\nseriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the\\ngospel.\\n\\n> ... Why don\\'t I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me\\n> tell you something about Christianity? ...\\n\\nIn a sense, the wide variety of interpretations does tell us\\nsomething about Christianity.  It tells us that the New Testament\\nauthors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve\\nas the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about the\\nnature of the Christian god and about what men should and\\nshouldn\\'t do. \\n\\nThe irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per\\nse that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and\\ngays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause is\\neffective only through the extra-Christian principles through\\nwhich Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes apply\\nthe *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, to\\ntheir cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that\\nmake Michael\\'s Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would\\nbe as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by\\nChristian interpretation.  \\n\\nMichael paints a picture of \"standard American atheism\" as the\\nrejection of the evil in many conservative Christian\\ninterpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even more\\ndamaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents\\nsuch a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and\\nthe nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered by\\nan interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).  Here, I\\nthink we should apply a Christian parable, where a cold drink can\\nhave its value and a hot drink can have its value, but the\\nlukewarm we should spit out. \\n\\nRussell\\n',\n",

The heat source\\nis a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it\\'s a vertical wooden box with\\nventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air\\nto flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are\\nspaced every 6\" starting about 10\" above the bulb.\\n\\nOr, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Use\\nyour oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may\\nnot have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins or\\nracks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on my\\noven - if yours goes down to 120 that\\'s probably even better.)  Stick a\\nwooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close\\nthe door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows\\nfor airflow.

In 1838, the governor of Missouri,\\n#>governor Boggs, issued his so-called \"Mormon extermination order.\"  The\\n#>only crime (\"illegal activity\") the Latter-day Saints had committed, was\\n#>their religious affiliation, their anti-slave stance (Missouri still\\n#>allowed slave practices), and their growing numbers/influence in Missouri.\\n#>\\n#>I guess the Mormons \"got what they deserved,\" because they refused to bow\\n#>to the will of (corrupt and evil) secular authorities. This \"disobedience\"\\n#>brought upon them persecution, murder, and finally forced expulsion from\\n#>their lands and settlements...\\n#\\n#It is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by\\n#\"average\" people, and that at the time, almost all Americans were pretty\\n#homogeonously Christian. It was largely the mainstream Christian\\'s disgust\\n#at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred.\\n\\nTrue, but that is exactly the \"problem\": the Mormon extermination order\\nwas issued not just by a Christian, it was ALLOWED under the Constitution\\nof the United States, which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents\\nlike this \"order\" from occurring in the first place...  As I indicated in\\nan earlier posting, your \"irrational hatred\" is clearly evidenced by\\nindividuals like Robert Weiss (who could have been Gov. Boggs\\' Lieutenant;\\nhe would have fitted right in, drewling et al), and seems a modern-day\\noccurrence, based on results (slander, persecution, misrepresentation,\\nlies, denying Mormons representation in their own user group, etc. etc.\\n\\nIn intent and purpose, what really has changed?\\n\\n#The situation is not entirely different today.  Many irrational feelings\\n#and beliefs are justified through religion.  I don\\'t think most of them\\n#are started because of religion, but religion certainly helps justify and\\n#perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification\\n#which discourages critical thought.\\n\\nTrue, as evidenced by numerous examples, as I am sure you\\'re aware.\\n\\n#>In any regard, Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (and\\n#>I don\\'t even discuss how Uthan\\'s were suckered into allowing part of their\\n#>lands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far from\\n#>being trusted or righteous.  Have things really changed for the better?  I\\n#>may be a born cynic, but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been the\\n#>case. In the early 1980s, I believe, the late President Kimball (lds church\\n#>leader) strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MX-\"Peace Keeper\"\\n#>missile maze from being built in Utah (yet another \"inspired\" decision from\\n#secular authorities).  Fortunately, his opposition was influential enough\\n#for the feds to back off.\\n#\\n#Do you mean that the \"secular authorities\" are some continuous group of\\n#people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassing/eradicating the\\n#Mormons?  Do you honestly believe that the main reason for using Utah for\\n#nuclear testing etc.. was to \"get them thar Mormons\"?  And what about the\\n#majority of Uthan\\'s who aren\\'t Mormons?  You seem to be searching for enemy\\n ^^^^^^^^\\n(Correction: the majority of Utahn\\'s ARE Mormon (60-70% I believe, up to a\\n 100% in many cities and settlements throughout the Western states.)\\n\\n#conspiracies.  It is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you\\n#badly must have been done primarily for that purpose.\\n\\nWhat I mean is that secular authorities are to be watched, as we believe\\nthat Satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert\\ntruth, judgment, and justice.  In addition, we believe that the adversary\\nhas power to influence the unjust and idolatrous (greed for money would be\\na good example) in order to bring about persecution, war, oppression, and\\nevil combinations.  As an intelligent being, don\\'t you suppose that the\\ndestroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power?\\n\\nAs far as Utah is concerned, what I pointed out were some horrible examples\\nof environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities, which have\\nbrought death, disease, (i.e. the \"downwinders\") and environmental contami-\\nnation.  I am hardly \"paranoid,\" I am just not \"expecting\" too much from a\\nsecular government that may not share our values and faith, and which indeed\\n(as Gov. Boggs et al.) may be out to harm and destroy us.  As a matter of\\nfact, prophecies in my church indicate that in future years, (global)\\npersecution against Mormons will so increase in intensity and scope, that\\n(paraphrasing) \"all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must\\nflee to Zion.\"  Zion (the \"pure in heart\") will be re-established in those\\ndays, and it AIN\\'T our current secular authorities who will rule over it...\\n\\n#>...

Sure, he did not pose a threat to the security of\\n#this nation.  But he did pose a threat to the lives of his followers.  That\\n#much is definite.\\n\\nHmmm.  \"definite\" by whom?  --Until such has been established beyond reason-\\nable doubt, this alleged \"threat\" may have been less than the \"threat\"\\nimposed upon him and his followers by the BATF and FBI...\\n\\n#>Who killed who?

Could it be that\\n#>the ATF/FBI presence has any bearing upon the events?  How would you\\n#>interpret the Mt. Masada events?  --Blame the Jews?  (What the heck did\\n#>the Romans do there anyway?  What business did the ATF/FBI has in Waco,\\n#>Texas???)  The Branch Davidians NEVER posed any threat to society.\\n#\\n#This is like asking who REALLY caused the deaths of the Israeli Olympic\\n#team in 1976?  In that case, the police botched the job as well.  But to\\n#lay a heavier burden on them than the terrorists would be a terrible\\n#mistake.  I think the same sort of reasoning applies in this case.\\n#Certainly, if David Koresh chose any peaceful option, the ATF and FBI\\n#would have complied.  The responsibility is more his than the authorities.\\n\\nCome now, at issue is in how much the authorities escalated an otherwise\\npeaceful stand-off: \"let\\'s get it over with, and \"force\" David Koresh to\\ncome out???\"  --By gassing them???

After having it awhile\\nI noticed two things about the function generator. For one, there\\nseems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is,\\nI have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some\\nrandom 50mV bias.\\n\\tThe other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output\\nwon't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessed\\nfrom my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the input\\nimpedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have\\nmaximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have\\ninput impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order to\\nuse my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing\\nreasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my\\ncircuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.\\nWith the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now\\nwith this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind of\\na pain in  the ass.\\n\\tIs there any way I could make myself a little box that could\\nsolve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator\\ninput, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some\\nlow, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor\\nof one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'd\\nlike to have this box not be active.\\n\\tAny quick ideas. The scope's not broken. For other reasons I\\nhad sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it. The\\nfunction generator was the same way on that one, too.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tplease help as I am feeling very stupid \\n\\t\\t\\ttoday,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdave \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdgj2y@virginia.edu\\n\\n\",\n",

That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor\\nhere to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the\\ncurrent shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing\\nand the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open,\\nthis resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the\\nstrings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.  \\nOr use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get\\none.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these\\ndraw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.\\n\\nWhat you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light \\nat full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current \\nfrom the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing \\nboth strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a \\nlow brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow \\nat reduced brightness. \\n\\nBe sure to wire and insulate the splices, resistor leads, and cut wires \\nin a safe manner!\\n\",\n",

Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon.\\nLines: 170\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: atlantis.csos.orst.edu\\n\\nThis is the final public update to my dragon magazine auction.  If there\\nare no new bids then the current bids stand (like that\\'s gonna  happen.  :) ).\\nAfter this, any updates will be by E-mail *ONLY*.  The entire auction \\nwill end as soon as the bids stop coming in.  So if you want to get in\\non  this, be sure to bid now.  All bids must be made in *AT LEAST*\\n25 cent increments.  Buyer will pay shipping.  (Unless you have any\\nparticular fancy, it will be US mail 4th class special, with lots of\\npadding).  \\nAll dragons are bagged.  The condition of them vary quite a bit, \\nso I\\'ve come up with my own condition system.  Some dragons may be missing \\nitems like the inserts.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.\\n*\\nCondition ratings - Usually this is just an evaluation of the cover, as\\nmost of the material inside is in great shape.\\nExcellent - IE-\"As you find them in the store\"\\nVery Good - Still in great condition, but can tell it\\'s been boughten\\nGood      - On down the line\\nVery Fair/fair - indicates lots of use (But still \"decent\")\\nPoor      -  Indicates the material inside may be damaged (usually by\\nscissors).  \\nA * by the condition indicates that something from the magazine is \\nmissing (usually the insert)\\nI\\'ll post another public update sometime this weekend (which will be the\\nfinal public posting, after which the auction will be by e-mail until\\nthe bidding stops)\\n*\\nAgain if you have any questions, ask away.\\n*\\narrow      $2.50 056 -

Laughs & serious questions about real religion.\\nKeywords: Eveism, religion, \\nNntp-Posting-Host: rs6101.ecs.rpi.edu\\nOrganization: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy NY\\nLines: 102\\n\\nLet me begin by saying I think this is the world\\'s first religion to use\\nthe net as its major recruitment medium.  Therefore, even if this\\nreligion does not take off, its founding members will be very important\\nhistorically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become \\ncommon.\\n\\nThe basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional\\nmorality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible\\'s\\naccounts of the facts and historical events is correct.\\n\\nFor example,\\n\\nStory of Adam and Eve:\\nAdam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimited\\nsupply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God says\\nnot to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide \\nin bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden.\\n(There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in\\nthe bushes that might have angered God.)\\n\\nTraditional Philosophy:\\n1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will\\nprovide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it\\'s OK. This\\nis why married women usually didn\\'t work until recent decades.\\n2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler \\nand slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without \\nquestion by ordinary people, who can\\'t make decisions for themselves.\\n\\nInterpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy:\\nThey were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God\\ntold them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were\\nobligated to do whatever their \"Father\" said to.  Being forced to leave the \\nGarden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.\\n\\nLessons from Traditional Interpretation:\\n1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting.\\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is ideal.  Get-\\nting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment.\\n3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad.\\n4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and \\nshould do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for \\nthemselves.\\n5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from\\nlearning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.\\n\\n1990\\'s philosophy:\\n1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless\\nnamed \"Hillary Clinton\" or \"Murphy Brown\".\\n2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people \\n(binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.\\n\\nInterpretation of events based on current philosophy:\\nThey were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge\\nrather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge\\nand (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them-\\nselves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were \\nREWARDED by being allowed into the \"real world.\"\\n\\nLessons from new interpretation:\\n1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought.\\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is at best\\na temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn\\nis ideal.\\n3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good.\\n4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and\\nshould consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and \"alter\\nor abolish\" bad governments.  They should think for themselves.\\n5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge\\nbut should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children \\nwithout good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better\\nlife for their children (and themselves).\\n\\nI have tentatively named this new philosophy \"The Church of Eveism\" because\\nEve\\'s decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind\\'s first good decision, instead\\nof its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearly\\na protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek \\nknowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded the\\ndecision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention\\nand desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it \\nuntil it was actively sought.\\n\\n---End serious discussion.

They are essentially\\ndouble conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz.\\nThe receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used\\npreviouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham\\nRadio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.\\n\\n  The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used\\nat these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design\\nof this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).\\n\\n  While using this would have let me reduce the \"external\" IF count on\\nreceive, it didn\\'t really offer all that much help on transmit so I\\ndidn\\'t bother with it.\\n\\n  The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2\\nMHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios\\nactually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and\\nspeed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data\\nstream is another matter entirely.\\n\\n  Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a\\n\"beacon\" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow\\ndue to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO\\nalso shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even\\nthough the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes\\nof the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of\\na second.\\n\\n  I\\'ve been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in\\nand get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland\\nIDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the\\nproceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running\\nlow on resources of time, money and energy.\\n\\n  If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW\\nID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma\\nMtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally\\npolarized.\\n\\n  I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly\\napproach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and\\nyou might want to carefully consider your \"target\".  If you can\\'t\\narrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think\\nyou\\'ll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by\\nmultipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS.\\nFor more details, see the 10th CNC.

The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\n the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\\n\\n  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \\netymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the\\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning\\nwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly\\ntribe\" and perhaps to \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is\\nprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Magoi\" as one of\\nthe six tribes of the Medes.\\n  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\\npriestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\\nresponsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\\nknowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\\npriesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\\nmonarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\\nthrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\\nGreat (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\\nand civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced\\nconcerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\\n(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\\ndemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\\nDarius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\\nGreek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\\nthe Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\\n  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\\nsacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\\npossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\\nattested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\\n  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\\nare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\\nthe priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\\nuntenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\\nAvestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is\\nnot without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\\nin conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\\npurity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two opposed principles of spirit\\nand matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \"chorus,\" from\\nthe root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and\\nhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\\necstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\\nthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\\nmagavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\\nAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\\na recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\\nthe Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \\nperhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \\n(Gershevitch, 1964).\\n  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\\nPahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\\nparticular derives from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). During\\nthe Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\\na hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of\\nhigh priests\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\\nhierarchy.\\n  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\\nkhwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\\nthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\\nThe corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\\nof putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\\ncommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\\nParsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\\nrite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\\nin vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\\nwax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\\nof Central Asia.\\n  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\\noffer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\\nritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\\ncustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\\nrelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\\ncalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\\nknown for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\\nsuch as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\\ntunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\\nfelt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\\nand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\\nbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\\nthat is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\\nthat of the priesthood: white.\\n  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\\npossession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\\ngradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\\nprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\\ninclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\\njealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\\nthey were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\\nfor teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\\nthe \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\\nthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\\nmaster of himself.\\n  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\\ninfluence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\\nseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\\nGaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\\nSmerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\\nthe Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\\nin Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\\nas a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\\n  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\\nrenowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\\nthe greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\\nwho arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\\nBethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\\nalso known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\\nthis was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\\nlike \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\\nChaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\\nhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\\n  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\\nis necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\\nwestern Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\\nhave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\\nIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\\ncontact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\\nvarying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\\n  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\\nvarying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\\nhistorians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\\ncustoms, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\\nbelief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\\nand eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\\neven speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\\nMagi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\\nZoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\\nplaced themselves under his venerable name.\\n  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\\neastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\\nelements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\\noften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\\nZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\\ndaivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\\ntexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\\npractices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\\nchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\\nsupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\\nGathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\\nall evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\\nland of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\\nhas been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\\nabsence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\\npriesthood, would be very strange.\\n  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\\ncorpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\\nfirst millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\\ndirectly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\\nus especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\\nthe ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\\nof the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\\nspirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\\nMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\\nformation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\\nastrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\\nMesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\\nto the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\\nsee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\\nwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\\n  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\\nimportant role in the transmission of Zarathushtra\\'s treachings, as well as in\\nthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\\nnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\\nZoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\\nto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\\nHermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\\non the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\\nsurvived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\\nwisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\\nof such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\\nabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\\n  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\\nground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\\n_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\\nmost likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\\nsecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\nthe Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\nto Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\\n  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the\\nreligious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,\\n1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\\nIran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to\\nestablish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an\\northodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures\\nin the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar\\nand Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.\\n\\nSAOSHYANT:\\n  The Avestan term saoshyant (\"future benefactor\"; MPers., soshans) designates\\nthe savior of the world, who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind.\\nThe concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of Zoro-\\nastrianism, together with that of dualism; it appears as early as in the Gathas.\\nZarathushtra (Zoroaster), as the prophet of the religion, is himself a Sao-\\nshyant, one who performs his works for the Frashokereti, the end of the present\\nstate of the world, when existence will be \"rehabilitated\" and \"made splendid.\"\\n[See Frashokereti]\\n  Later Zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological\\nmyth and expanded the number of Saoshyants from one to three. All the saviors\\nare born from the seed of Zarathushtra, which is preserved through the ages in\\nLake Kansaoya (identified with present-day Lake Helmand, in Seistan, Iran),\\nprotected by 99,999 fravashis, or guardian spirits. The greatest of the awaited\\nSaoshyants, the victorious Astvatereta (\"he who embodies truth\"), the son of\\nthe Vispataurvairi (\"she who conquers all\"), is the third, who will make\\nexistence splendid; he appears in Yashts 19. Upon his arrival humankind will\\nno longer be subject to old age, death, or corruption, and will be granted\\nunlimited power. At that time the dead will be resurrected, and the living will\\nbe immortal and indestructable. Brandishing the weapon with which he kills the\\npowerful enemies of the world of truth (that is, the world of the spirit, and\\nof asha), Astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and\\nrender it imperishable. He and his comrades will engage in a great battle with\\nthe forces of evil, which will be destroyed.\\n  The name Astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation\\n(Kellens, 1974), as are those of his two brothers, Ukhshyatereta, \"he who makes\\ntruth grow,\" and Ukhshyatnemah, \"he who makes reverence grow\"; the names of the\\nthree virgins (Yashts 13) who are impregnated with the seed of Zarathushtra\\nwhen they bathe in Lake Kansaoya and give birth to the Saoshyants, are equally\\nspeculative. Each of these Saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a\\nmillennium, initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence; Astvatereta will\\nappear in the third and final millennium to save mankind.\\n  The doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the Archaemenid\\nperiod (sixth to fourth century BCE). It was not, perhaps the principal element\\nin the formation of the messianic idea, but it was certainly a determining\\nfactor, one that enjoyed great success in the Hellenistic period beyond the\\nconfines of the Iranian world. A similar concept, that of the future Buddha,\\nMaitreya, was most likely indebted to it, and Christian messianism can trace\\nits roots to the same source.\\n',\n",

       " 'From: schmidt@auvax1.adelphi.edu\\nSubject: Grounding power wiring, was Re: a question about 120VAC outlet wiring\\nLines: 163\\nNntp-Posting-Host: auvax1\\nOrganization: Adelphi University, Garden City NY\\n\\nThere has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding\\npractices here.  A few points need to be clarified:\\n\\nThe Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or\\nthe metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to\\ncarry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the\\nvoltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It\\nshould never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the\\nnormal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in\\nthe power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding\\nconductor.  \\n\\nMuch communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages\\non the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding\\nconductors to provide reliable operation  (\"orange\" outlets are often used for\\nthis, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in\\nmany cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read\\nboth the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on\\ninstalling quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated\\ngrounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors\\nback to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service\\nentrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many\\nof these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide\\na safe ground or a quiet ground or either. \\n\\nThe GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is\\nreferred to in the code as the \"identified\" conductor and is supposed to be\\nwhite or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in\\nmost electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance\\npanel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household\\nservice panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which\\nattaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  \\n\\nThe Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In\\nthe case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the\\ncircuit from the panel to the load device.  \\n\\nSince the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding\\nconductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance\\nfrom the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but\\nmeasurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,\\nunder normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the\\ngrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of\\nthe neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since\\nthere will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also\\nno longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment\\nhas a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \"U\"\\nground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. \\nThe difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few\\ntenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not\\npresent a shock hazard.  \\n\\nHOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact\\nwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,\\na metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to\\nflow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you\\nwill get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)\\nUnder the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in\\nsome cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of\\ninadequate size, causing it to overheat.\\n\\nWith the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a\\nshort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may\\nflow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which\\nincreases the possibility for shock or fire.  \\n\\nAlso if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on\\nthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often\\ncausing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in\\ntechnical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.\\n\\nThe Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as\\nwell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for\\nlightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back\\nto ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded\\nobjects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses\\nquickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the\\ndwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it\\nflows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause\\ncorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,\\nand it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop\\nbetween the \"hot\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the\\nwater pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. \\n(don\\'t flame ME on this, I\\'m just telling you where the field comes from, not\\nit\\'s health effect, as far as I\\'m concerned, the jury is still out on this.)\\n\\nNote that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any\\nsub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service\\nentrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have\\na seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this\\napplication only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the\\ngrounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding\\nscrew, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above\\nground, with the possible problems listed above.\\n\\nThe code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one\\nbuilding to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be\\nused as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate\\nwire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. \\nThese exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days\\nbefore U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don\\'t want to\\nhave to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don\\'t want to\\nhave to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place\\nof three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate\\nneutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings\\n(since most current is in the 220 volt \"hots\" except at some low settings, the\\nwires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. \\nSo far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,\\nit\\'s primarily for lightning protection.\\n\\nPeople doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn\\'t a legal grounding\\nconductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \"romex\" \\'with ground\\' is.  Anywhere\\nthere is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good\\ngrounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes\\nis a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under\\nthe steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this\\naluminum band off at the ends, you don\\'t have to bond it to anything, it does\\nits job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall\\ntubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding\\nlocknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  \\n\\n\"Greenfield\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty\\nsheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn\\'t have\\nthe aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and\\ninductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the\\ngreenfield.\\n\\n\"Wiremold\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes\\noften prevents good contact, and the \"feed\" to the wiremold extension is often\\nfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold\\nbox.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and\\nthe cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \"hot\" with\\n120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator\\nhere in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one\\nof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a\\nground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in\\nthe original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \"bond\" the wire to the\\nbox with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.\\n\\nOn another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets\\nwhen ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them\\nwithout a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the\\nprotection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don\\'t\\ninstall it.  The interrupter doesn\\'t depend on the ground to trip.  It is\\ndesirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is\\nconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,\\nwhereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something\\nprovides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded\\nGCFI\\'s, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my \\'93\\ncode is in the city, but I know the rule hasn\\'t changed.  It might be\\nrenumbered though.) \\n\\nWe have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more\\nto this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.  \\n\\nJohn\\n-- \\n*******************************************************************************\\nJohn H.

They are standard\\n\\t\\tequipment.\\n\\n\\t2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?\\n\\n\\t\\ta)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.

It is as non-flammable as possible.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t.... gotcha!\\n\\n\\t\\t  ... when in isolation from other substances.\\n\\n\\t\\t  WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote\\n\\t\\t  launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce \"this window,\\n\\t\\t  blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come\\n\\t\\t  down\", and maintain a left to right sequence?\\n\\n\\t\\tb)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when\\n\\t\\t  mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)\\n\\t\\t  suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to\\n\\t\\t  brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long\\n\\t\\t  exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend\\n\\t\\t  to ignite.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat other chemicals come up in the forensics?\\n\\t\\t\\tWho else will be allowed to test the site?\\n\\n\\t\\tc)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation\\n\\t\\t  rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made\\n\\t\\t  to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature\\n\\t\\t  above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain\\n\\t\\t  heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length\\n\\t\\t  of time (start a wall fire and wait).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tCheck your military records; look at the tapes.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhy were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),\\n\\t\\t\\ttear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why\\n\\t\\t\\tthe hurry. was there still a comm channel open\\n\\t\\t\\tto the outside?).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tDo you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the\\n\\t\\t\\tcompound in the videos?

Some magazines also provide the data on\\nself-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the\\ndata on computer disk.\\n\\nThe advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will\\nnotice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called\\na \"bingo card\" in the industry) includes lines for a company name\\nand a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national\\nadvertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as\\nbest they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company\\nand include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably\\nsend you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer\\ncall you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they\\nwill send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail\\noutlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th\\ne whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have\\nnothing to mail out accept the catalog.\\n\\nA couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry\\nmagazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They\\nuse the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read\\nthe magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push\\nyou, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile\\nhow many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.\\nThis way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that \"23% of readers\\nrequesting data were interested in capacitors.\" And finally, some\\nmagazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For\\nexample, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information\\nabout test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC\\'s, in the past 6 months.\\n\\nThe other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines\\ninclude how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the\\nadvertiser can attempt to cull out the \"literature collectors\" from\\nthe serious potential customers.\\n\\n\"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.\"\\n\\nWhat\\'s the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?\\n\\n  Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more\\n  than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of\\n  weeks later.\\n\\n  If you are really, really serious and you really, really want\\n  the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also\\n  cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually\\n  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data\\n  on a computer printout.\\n\\n  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you\\'re\\n  not really \"qualified\" for, send in a bingo card at least every\\n  other month and circle two or three numbers.\\n\\n  Include a business name and phone number, even if it\\'s your house.\\n  Advertisers almost never call. \\n\\nJohn Schuch\\n  publisher of: The Arizona High-Tech Times\\n                The Arizona Electrical Journal\\n                The Arizona HVAC News\\n  (all of which have bingo cards)\\n\\n\\n',\n",

This man has\\nfled his responsibility, has behaved like a lazy coward, and has turned\\naway from his responsibility to his wife and child.\\n\\nHowever, if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden,\\nshe is not thought of in the same way.  When the man abandons, the woman\\nsuffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life.\\nWhen the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed\\nout, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly that\\nhe wishes he could trade places with his child.\\n\\nThs root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, \"My\\nfeelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung.\"\\nAnd when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of.\\nIt\\'s the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and his\\ndemons for all of eternity.

After he and his brother Hyram\\n#were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over\\n#who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like\\n#Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider\\n#Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I\\'m led to understand.  Make\\n#no mistake, this was no messiah we\\'re talking about in Smith).  The\\n\\nAnd neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral\\naptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have\\nnothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only \"crime\"\\nwas that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried\\nto explain the \"Smith phenomenon\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5\\nmillion member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith\\'s\\ntestimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.\\n\\n#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed\\n#down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only\\n#entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have\\n#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The\\n#Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn\\'t of much help\\n#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.\\n#Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited\\n#for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other\\n#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)\\n\\n\"The rest\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church,\\nwhile the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various\\nauxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new\\nprophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and\\ndoctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in\\nline to fill the prophet Joseph Smith\\'s vacancy: he was the senior\\napostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated\\nthat it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.\\n\\nOther rightful \"heirs\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated\\n(Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,\\nJoseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty\\nland beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This\\n\"Rekhabite\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated\\nby the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.\\n\\nGranted, a couple of \"do-it-yourselfers\" stayed behind, unwilling to\\nsacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but\\nthis also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The\\nchurch benefitted from this purification process: they became even\\nmore unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.\\n\\n#        Both sects practiced the \"1-year food stockpile\" doctrine,\\n#and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at\\n#least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a\\n#militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than\\n#face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a\\n#great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite\\n#justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,\\n#this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people\\n#had nobody to turn to save themselves.\\n#\\n#        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.\\n\\nBTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of\\nthe largest denominations in the country) a \"sect\"???  It didn\\'t \"splinter\"\\nfrom any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.\\n\\n#>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very\\n#>impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They\\'re pledged to defend\\n#>secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actually\\n#>do - even to the point of suicide.)\\n\\nWhat a balloney.  Suicide is sinful and against the law of God.  I am\\nnot comfortable with this alleged \"cosiness\" with Mammon: I assure you\\nthat *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  Our\\nONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has\\nappointed to represent Him.  In any regard, to read this TRASH (about\\nsuicide and \"atone for sins with blood\") is yet another insulting\\nmisrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for...\\n\\n#\\n#        The RLDS, the Reorganized LDS, are friendly rivals of the LDS\\n#and delight in telling stories about them, which generates quick retorts\\n#from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time.  At no time have\\n#I ever even heard this hinted at.  I\\'m taking it with a salt block.\\n\\nMake it a really big salt mountain with a glacier on top.\\n\\n#>  So he hired virtually no one but\\n#>Mormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the\\n#>Church of Later Day Saints.  Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBI\\n#>personnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon.\\n#>I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI\\'s treatment\\n#>of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.\\n\\nPreposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I\\nam convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes\\nof honor and conduct (that\\'s why they were selected for in the\\nfirst place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith\\nSTRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all\\npeople are free to worship \"*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.\"\\n\\n#        If it\\'s true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS\\n#philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true\\n#Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his\\n#own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may\\n#as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You\\n#can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected\\n#it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to\\n#Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they\\n#will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover\\n#liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade\\n#alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.\\n#These people are the \"salt of the Earth\" and as such are more\\n#easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.\\n\\nA good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds people\\nare sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon\\'s \"orders\" (the late\\npresident Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strong\\nopposition of the selection of the MX \"Peace Keeper\" missile maze\\nin Utah).\\n\\n#        That\\'s my somewhat educated guess, anyway.  Both sects have\\n#splinter groups that don\\'t mirror the masses, but these are small\\n#and rare, and hardly worth noting their common ancestry.\\n#\\n#        None of this has any relevance to guns, though.

       " \"From: verity@jack.sns.com (Steve Verity)\\nSubject: Need help with video detection circuit\\nOrganization: Systems'n'Software\\nLines: 55\\n\\n\\n\\nI am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video (Vs.\\na blank screen) by monitoring the R,G, and B outputs of a graphics\\ncard.  It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at\\n65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be\\nable to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)\\nand a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be\\ncheap.  \\n\\nMy first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each\\ncompariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input\\nwent to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).\\n\\nThe first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I\\nneeded to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the\\ncompariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my\\ncircuit would not detect it.   \\n\\nThe second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then\\nthe smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In\\nfact the difference between completely black and completely white is\\nonly 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the\\nvideo signals to make this work.  \\n\\nThere are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require \\nsplit supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariator\\nwith three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply\\ncircuit.  \\n\\nAt this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistor\\ncircuit.  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...\\n\\nUnfortunately, I am way out of my league when It comes to designing\\ntransistor circuits, so I am appealing to the net for help.  Any\\nideas, tips, circuits, pointers, references, etc. would be greatly\\nappreciated.  \\n\\nOh yes, I only sample the output of this thing every second or so, so\\nI don't need a fast response time at all, however, I haven't found a\\nway to take advantage of that fact.\\n\\nThanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give.

Be free\\nfrom all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be\\nestablished in the self.\\n  \\n                                PURPORT\\n\\n All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three\\nmodes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which\\ncause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive\\nactivities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of\\nsense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna,\\nas a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to\\nthe transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the\\nbeginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme\\ntranscendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are\\nstruggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of\\nthe material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get\\nrid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense\\ngratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the\\nchance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the\\nUpanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a\\npart of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the\\nbeginning of transcendental life.\\n\\n As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in\\nthe material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities\\nsuch as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating\\nsuch dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This\\ntranscendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one\\nis fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.\\n\\nBhagavad-Gita As It is\\nBooks of A.C.

A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods\\nor service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in \\nusefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality\\nconsidered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as\\nof a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7.

Note that\\nthese definitions do not mean the same thing.\\n\\nIn my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a\\nreach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the\\nword \"value\" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard\\nof measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its\\nbasis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one\\nconcludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on\\nsystems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a\\nscientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as\\n\"objective values.\"\\n\\nBack to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow.\\nJust because the word \"values\" is used in both contexts does not mean\\nthat there is a relationship between the two contexts.\\n\\nIf one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must\\nfirst start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering\\nthe meaning of the word \"objective\" I doubt that this will ever happen.\\n\\nSo, back to the original question:\\n\\nAnd objective morality is.....?\\n\\nIf you can provide an objective foundation for \"morality\" then that will\\nbe a good beginning.\\n\\n>-- \\n>Frank O\\'Dwyer                                  \\'I\\'m not hatching That\\'\\n>odwyer@sse.ie                                  from \"Hens\",  by Evelyn Conlon\\n\\neric\\n',\n",

A much more likely explanation\\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.

I purposely used \"handle\" in order to \\navoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are\\naberrations like \"scientific\" creationism).  I used \"best\" in part to indicate \\nthat science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are\\nmostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the\\nmatter.  As an aside, for science I should have written \"how and when\".  Nobody\\nseems to argue over what.\\n\\n>Are they [theists, theologians] any better equiped to investigate the \"who and \\n>why\" than magicians, astrologers, housewives [not being sexists], athiests or \\n>agnostics.\\n\\nSeems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I\\'m not\\ntrying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.\\nOn the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which\\nyou know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological\\nperspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I \\nthink the masses can\\'t get along without religion.  Not that generally they are \\nincapable; they just don\\'t, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to \\nbe the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore \\nit seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for \\ndispensing answers to \"who and why\".  I suggest that this holds regardless of \\nthe \"truth\" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  \\nIn the end, spiritual beliefs are just as \"real\" as scientific facts and \\nexplanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).  \\n\\n>Do you suggest that the \"who and why\" will forever be closed to scientific \\n>investigation?\\n\\nNo.  In fact, I don\\'t think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. \\nIsn\\'t there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was \\ncreated from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might \\npresuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued \\nthat something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn\\'t\\nhave to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that\\'s a tough one for\\npeople today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not \\nexplanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words, \\nI agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific \\nas explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but \\nI sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will \\nbe necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty \\nconvoluted here; I hope I\\'ve made sense.  \\n\\n>It seems to me that 200 or so years ago, the question of the origin of life on\\n>earth was not considered open to scientific enquiry.\\n\\nI agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, \\nwhen, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment, \\nreason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, \\nand not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the \\nnaturalists\\' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely \\nleaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, and\\nthe arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.\\n\\n>|>Rich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota\\n\\n>Did like your discussion around AMHs, and I did figure out what AMH was from\\n>your original post :-)\\n\\nMuch obliged.
